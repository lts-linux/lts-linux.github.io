This pubic key can be armored public GPG key,\ne.g. form a URL or a local file, or a non-armored binary GPG key,\ne.g. form the local /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/.\nFor receiving both types of keys, a download is tried if the provided string starts with ‘http’,\nelse the string is interpreted as a local path.\nIf no verification is wanted, the value Key::NoSignatureCheck can be provided.\n\n\nStruct Release\nThe struct [Release] groups all information contained in the InRelease file.\nWhen a new [Release] is created by running [Release::from_distro],\nthe content of the InRelease file is downloaded,\nthe inline signature is verified using the [Distro] key,\nand the content is parsed.\n\nThe struct [Release] provides also some convenience methods to access the package indices.\nThe method [Release::get_package_links] provides all available package indices.\nThis means, for each combination of architecture and component,\nthe function [get_etag] is used to check if the URL really exists,\nand if the URL exists, the [Link] is provided.\nThe return value of this method is a Vec&lt;(String, Architecture, Link)&gt;,\nand each tuple consists of component name, architecture, and URL to the index as [Link].\nThe method [Release::get_package_index_link] provides the [Link] to one specific package index.\nThe parameters are the component name and the architecture, and the result is a [Link].\n\nStruct Link\nThe [Link] struct groups references to files, i.e. URLs,\nwith the hash sums to verify the file, and the size of the file.\nThe supported hash types are MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512.\nWhen the file is downloaded, the best available hash is verified to ensure the integrity.\n\nStruct PackageIndex\nThe struct [PackageIndex] groups all packages of one component and architecture.\nThis structure also provides support for parsing the apt repository package index files.\n\n\nStruct Package\nThe metadata about binary packages are grouped in the struct [Package].\nThe packages are parsed from the so called stanzas of the package indices.\n\nStruct SourceIndex\nThe struct [SourceIndex] groups all source packages of one component.\nThis structure also provides support for parsing the apt repository source package index files.\n\n\nStruct Source\nThe metadata about source packages are grouped in the struct [Source].\nThe source packages are parsed from the so called stanzas of the source package indices.\n","description":"A first version if libapt is ready to
