Long term maintaining an embedded Linux solution with current mainstream approaches is possible, even if it's not easy if we target 15+ years, but it's lot's of effort.

Open source has the answer how to solve "big" problems:

Share the effort!

Our approach is to share the maintenance effort with a lot of others, by building on top of Debian or Ubuntu. Debian has the advantage that it supports already many different architectures. There are also different commercial offers for long term mantained Debian solutions, like Ubuntu IoT or the Elektrbit corbos Linux, which targets automotive and other critical contexts.

This book is taking a closer look at different aspects of building and maintaining embedded Linux solutions, with a focus on this Debian based approach.
